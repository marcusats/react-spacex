# SpaceX API Single Page Application

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite that utilizes the SpaceX API to display information about launches, payloads, rockets, ships, launchpads, and cores. The application is designed as a lab exercise to demonstrate the use of React Function Components, React Router, and the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

## Features

- **React Function Components**: Utilizes functional components for a modern, hook-based approach to React development.
- **React Router**: Implements navigation between different components of the application without reloading the page.
- **SpaceX API Integration**: Fetches data from the SpaceX API for various entities such as launches, payloads, rockets, and more. No API key is required for GET requests.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Displays detailed information fetched from the API, providing users with up-to-date data on SpaceX activities.
